## History
This game was originally going to be just pure HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. After encountering complications, we decided to switch to Python. We started with PyGame, but found it too complex. We realized that the entire game was essentially a large GUI, and so we switched to using Tkinter, which would be much easier to work with and yeild results faster. This, however, didn't have all of the widgets we needed, so we switched to Kivy.
